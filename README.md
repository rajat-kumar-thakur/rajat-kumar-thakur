# Hi there, I'm Rajat Kumar Thakur! 👋

### 🚀 Machine Learning Enthusiast | LLM Researcher | Full Stack Developer

I am a curious explorer working at the intersection of **Machine Learning**, **Large Language Models**, and **Full Stack Development**. As a student passionate about building impactful digital solutions, I love transforming complex ideas into working products—whether it's optimizing LLMs for resource-constrained devices or building intuitive web apps.
